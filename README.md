The same thing Apple does â€” physically driven interactions.

There are no time based animations, everything is driven by mouse position, so that user feels much more in control. For example, notice how axes appear, hover bubbles change color, and selected line strenghtens, as you move the mouse more into chart's frame.

This effect is subtle but important.
